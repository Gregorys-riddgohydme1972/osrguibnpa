Just saw Snow White... Oh my goodness, where do I even start? Right out of the stuffy theater—I swear back there, second row, where the popcorn smell is like an attacking army in my nostrils. The woman behind me had this cough, like an old car trying to start, every time there was a quiet moment. Anyway, the dwarfs were... they were there, right? Like little mischievous bunches of grapes rolling around, causing all kinds of chaos. 

> Mirror, mirror, but more like glittery chaos in a shiny box with whooooosh and why does the evil queen have such amazing cheekbones? I can't even. You know there's a storyline but then I got distracted by the dwarf who's always sneezing, like he's plotting to take over the world with sheer nasal power. 

Oh, and at some point there was a deer, or a rabbit? Maybe it was a squirrel? I don't know, it looked at me through the screen, like really looked, and I thought, is this my spirit animal? And is Snow White supposed to be this trusting? She's eating apples from strangers like she didn't get the memo about stranger danger. Come on girl, even I've learned not to pick up nachos left on a theater seat.

Popcorn crumbs, they're like stars scattered all over my sweater, and is it weird I started humming along to the songs I don't even know? Or was that someone else's tune bleeding into my ears, like their brain's Spotify was on loud?

> Remember to download the movie for that friend who missed it, she's been asking, but good luck making sense of the chaos. I'm thinking, maybe it's better to watch the movie with subtitles because then you can pretend to read something important when your mind wanders off to those unbelievable cheekbones again.

Does the prince even have a personality? Felt like a cardboard cutout in a royal suit, who wanders in, kisses, and bam! Things are alright-ish. Except my back, it's still reminding me that theater seats are like medieval torture devices, but in a kind of grimy, popcorn-sticky way.
